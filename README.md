# Cardio Vascular Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

* The project aims to predict the Cardio Vascular Disease from the hospital patient records using Neural Network.

* The data was collected from four different hospitals - Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest; University Hospital, Zurich and Basel, Switzerland; Medical Center, Long Beach, and Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

* Data from four different hospitals from four different regions helps in achieving better generalization and prediction reliability.

* This data was preprocessed to remove unwanted data, fill missing data and drop irrelevant features.

*  Five Neural Network models built using Fully Connected Neural Network was trained on this data.

* Ensemble voting method was applied to these five models to improve the prediction accuracy of the model.

* The Ensemble of five models predicts if a patient has Cardio Vascular Disease or not.
